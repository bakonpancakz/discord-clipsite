## Building
Some dependencies `(notably SQLite)` requires **CGO** to properly compile the program. You can follow this [helpful guide](https://github.com/go101/go101/wiki/CGO-Environment-Setup) to set it up on your machine. 

Additionally, This program requires that both `FFmpeg` and `FFprobe` to be installed and available in your systems PATH.

Afterwards set the appropriate **CGO** environment variable `export CGO_ENABLED=1` and build it as normal.
```
go build -o shareclip main.go
```


## Database
This program stores all files in a single directory for simplicity and portability. 
By default, it creates a `data` folder in the current working directory. 
Below is an example layout after one video has been processed:

```py
.
|__ shareclip.elf                   # Compiled program
|__ /data
    |__ database.db                 # A SQLite Database which stores all user and video metadata.
    |__ /public                     # Note: All Files in the directory are public!
    |   |__ /avQCfm4YEz5            
    |       |__ video.mp4           # Uses value from ENCODER_OUTPUT_FILENAME_VIDEO
    |       |__ thumbnail.webp      # Uses value from ENCODER_OUTPUT_FILENAME_THUMBNAIL
    |
    |__ /video                      # Original uploaded videos
        |__ avQCfm4YEz5             # Stored without a file extension. 
                                    #   These can be safely deleted, although should be kept 
                                    #   for possible future re-encodes.
```

## Configuration
This program can be configured via a `.env` file in the working directory or by exporting them. 

**Required** Variables without a default value (denoted with a `...` in the default column) will throw an error and close the application with exit code 2.
